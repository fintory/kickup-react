## Constants

We are striving to have a clean and well-maintainable code base, hence we are using constants for many things like colors, sizes, etc.. Please continue to use constants, since they are an easy starting point, when changing something in the layout.

Be sure to swap styles to an external file for each component. This will increase the readability of your files.

## [polished](https://polished.js.org/docs/)

We love sass helper functions, mixins & won't miss them by using css-in-js. So we decided to use polished as an additional framework which delivers all the power of the familiar ones & make them available in you javascript files.
