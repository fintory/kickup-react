# Testing

> **Disclaimer:** This testing folder is copied from `react-boilerplate`. Be sure to give them props for this one.

- [Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)
- [Component Testing](component-testing.md)

Testing your application is a vital part of serious development. There are a few
things you should test. If you've never done this before start with [unit testing](unit-testing.md).
Move on to [component testing](component-testing.md) when you feel like you
understand that!

## Usage

To test your application started with this boilerplate do the following:

1. Sprinkle `.test.js` files in `__test__/` subdirectories next to the parts of your application you
   want to test.

1. Write your unit and component tests in those files.

1. Run `npm run test` in your terminal and see all the tests pass! (hopefully)

There are a few more commands related to testing, checkout the [commands documentation](../general/commands.md#testing)
for the full list!
