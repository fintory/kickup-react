# Greenkeeper

We are using [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) to keep our packages updated properly. For private repositories [this is paid](https://greenkeeper.io/#pricing). Please consult your head of development to check, if your organization is supporting Greenkeeper.io and the pricing model.

## Lockfile updates

The CI is configured to update the lockfiles for the boilerplate automatically. For this to work on your future projects, you need to [create a GitHub access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with **push access** to your repository and make it available to your CI's environment as `GH_TOKEN`. Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile#setup) for further setup.
