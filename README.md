## Why another boilerplate?

We at [Kreativgebiet](https://kreativgebiet.com)/[Fintory](https://fintory.com) aim to move fast and always on the bleeding-edge of technology. That's why we created our own boilerplate. Of course, we started with the boilerplate from [TJ](https://github.com/tj/frontend-boilerplate) and continued from where he left.
Since we always want to used bleeding-edge, we needed to have the ability to quickly adapt the boilerplate to our latest needs. That's, why `kickup-react` is here.

## What's in there?

| Module Name                    | What is it for?                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| :atom: React                   | Well, I think you know what this is for    |
| :zap: Redux                    | State management in React. Done right.     |
| :nut_and_bolt: Webpack         | Compilation of React and all other modules |
| :syringe: Babel                | Using ES6 things in ES5 browsers right now |
| :paintbrush: styled-components | Excellent CSS-in-JS framework              |
| :sparkles: Flow                | Type checker for ES6 and javascript        |
| :bug: eslint                   | Linting the Javascript-code                |

| :boom: CircleCI                | Automate deployments and integration tasks |

## How to set it up?

If you also want to use the `kickup-react` boilerplate, you can simply `git clone` the repository or download the zip file into your project folder and unzip it. If you are aiming to use this boilerplate, I assume that you are already familiar how to clone it into your `development` folder.

_Note:_ Be sure to change the README, package.json, etc. since there are some information about Kreativgebiet and the creators of this boilerplate.

### Development Setup

Basically all you need to do is run the following command into the freshly cloned folder, since webpack and npm is handling all that development stuff for you:

```sh
npm start
```

_Note:_ Or if you prefer `yarn` instead of `npm`, just use `yarn start`.

### Production Setup

Production-use is as easy as development setup. Again, only one simple command is needed for webpack to compile the whole application. A deployment process isn't included _yet_, but is planned, since we are always searching for the latest awesome and easiest deployment strategy (Remember -> Bleeding-edge).

```sh
npm run build # or yarn build
```
